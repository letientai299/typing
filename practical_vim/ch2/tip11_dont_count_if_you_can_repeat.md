Don't count if you can repeat.
------------------------------

_We can minimize the keystrokes required to perform certain tasks by providing
a count, but that doesn't mean that we should. COnsider the pros and cons of
counting versus repeating._

Suppose that we had the following text in our buffer:
```
Delete `m`ore than one word.
```

We want to do as the text says, changing it to read "Delete one word" instead.
That is to say, we're going to delete two words.

We can approach this in a handful of ways. Both `d2w` and `2dw` will work.
With `d2w` we invoke the delete command and then give `2w` as the motion. We
could read that as "delete two words". However, `2dw` turns things around. This
time the count applies to the delete command, but the motion acts over a single
word. We could read this as "delete a word two times." Putting semantics aside,
we get the same result either way.

Now let's consider an alternative: `dw.`. This we can read as "Delete a word
and then repeat".

To recap, our options are as following: `d2w`, `2dw`, or `dw.` - Three
keystrokes each. But which is best?

For our discussion, `d2w` and `2dw` are identical. After running either of
these, we can press the `u` key to undo, and the two words that were deleted
will appear again. Or, instead of undoing our change, we could repeat it with
the dot command, which would delete the next two words.

In the case of `dw.`, the result of pressing `u` or `.` is subtly different.
Here, the change was `dw`- "Delete word". So if we wanted to restore the two
words that were deleted, we'd have to undo twice: pressing `uu` (or `2u` if you
prefer). Pressing the dot command would just delete the next word rather than
the next two.

Now suppose that instead of deleting two words, our original intent was to
delete three words. By a small error in judgment, we run `dw2` instead of
`d3w`. What next? We can't use the dot command, because that would cause a
total of four words to be deleted. So we could either back up and revise our
count (`ud3w`) or continue by deleting the next word (`dw`).

If, on the other hand, we had used the command `dw.`. In the first place, we
would have to repeat the dot command only one more time. Because our original
change was simple `dw`, the `u` and `.` commands have more granularity. Each
acts upon one word at a time.

Now suppose that we want to delete seven words. We could either run `d7w`, or
`dw......` (that is, `dw` followed by the dot command six times).  Counting
keystrokes, we have a clear winner. But would you trust yourself to make the
right count?

Counting is tedious. I'd rather hit the dot command six times than spend the
same time looking ahead in order to reduce the number of keys that I have to
press. What if I hit the dot command one too many times? No matter, I just back
up by hitting the `u` key once.

Remember our mantra (from Tip 4, on page 8): act, repeat, reverse. Here it is
in action.

Use a count when it matters
---------------------------

Suppose that we want to change the text "I have couple of question" to instead
read "I have some more question." We could do so as follows:

Keystrokes                    |   Buffer Contents
------------------------------|--------------------------------
{start}                       |   I have a couple of questions.
`c3w`some more`<esc>`         |   I have some more questions.

In this scenario, it doesn't make much sense to use the dot command. We could
delete one word and then another (with the dot command)), but then we'd have to
switch gears and change to Insert mode (using `i` or `cw`, for example). To me,
that feels awkward enough that I'd rather go ahead and use a count.

There's another advantage to using a count: it gives us a clean and coherent
undo history. Having made this change, we could undo it with a single press of
the `u` key, which ties with the discussion in Tip 8, on page 16.

That same argument also goes in favor of counting (`d5w`) over repeating
(`dw....`), so my preferences may seem inconsistent here. You'll develop your
own opinion on this, depending on how much you value keeping your undo history
clean and whether or not you find it tiresome to use counts.
