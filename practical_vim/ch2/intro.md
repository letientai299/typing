Normal mode
===========

Normal mode is Vim's natural resting state. If this chapter seems surprisingly
short, then that's because most of this book is about how to use Normal mode!
Here, however, is where we cover some core concepts and general tips.

Other text editors spend most of their time in something that resembles Insert
mode. So to the Vim newcomer, it can seem strange that Normal mode is the
default. In Tip 7, on page 15, we'll begin explaining why this is by drawing an
analogy with the workspace of a painter.

Many Normal mode commands can be executed with a count, which causes them to be
run multiples times. In Tip 10, on page 20, we'll meet a pair of commands that
increment and decrement numerical values and see how these commands can be
combined with a count to do simple arithmetic.

Much of the power of Normal mode stems from the way that operator commands can
be combined with motions. We'll finis by looking at the consequences of this.
