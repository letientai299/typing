Tip 7: Pause with Your Brush Off the Page
=========================================

_For those unused to Vim, Normal mode can seem like a odd default. But
experienced Vim users have difficulty imagining it any other way. This tip uses
an analogy to illustrate the Vim way._

How much time do you reckon artists spend with their paint brushes in contact
with the canvas? No doubt it would vary from artist to artist, but I'd be
surprised if it counted for as much as half of the time painters spend at work.

Think of all of the things that painters do besides paint. They study their
subject, adjust the lighting, and mix paints into new hues. And when it comes
to applying paint to the canvas, who says they have to use brushes? A painter
might switch to a palette knife to achieve a different texture or use a cotton
swab to touch up the paint that's already been applied.

The painter does not rest with a brush on the canvas. And so it is with Vim.
Normal mode is the natural resting state. The clue is in the name, really.

Just as painters spend a fraction of their time applying paint, programmers
spend a faction of their time composing code. More time is spent thinking,
reading, and navigating from one part of a code base to another. And when we do
want to make a change, who says we have to switch to Insert mode? WE can
reformat existing code, duplicate it, move it a round, or delete it. From
Normal mode, we have many tools at our disposal.
