Tip 2: Don't Repeat Yourself
============================

_For such a common use case as appending a semicolon at the end of a series of
lines, Vim provides a dedicated command that combines two step into one_

Suppose that we have a snippet of JavaScript code like this:

```js
// the_vim_way/2_foo_bar.js
var foo = 1
var bar = 'a'
var foobar = foo + bar
```


We need to append a semicolon at the end of each line. Doing so involves moving
our cursor to the end of the line and then switching to Insert mode to make the
change. The `$` command will handle the motion for us, and then we can run
`a;<ESC>` to make the change.

To finish the job, we could run exact same sequence of keystrokes on the next
two lines, but that would be missing a trick. The dot command will repeat that
last change, so instead of duplicating out efforts, we could just run `j$.`
twice. Once keystroke (`.`) buys us three (`a.<ESC>`). It's a small saving, but
these efficiencies accumulate when repeated.

But let's take a closer look at this pattern: `j$.`. The `j` command moves the
cursor down one line, and then the `$` command moves it to the end of the line.
We've used two keystrokes just to maneuver our cursor into position so that we
can use the dot command. Do you sense that there's room for improvement here?


Reduce Extraneous Movement
--------------------------

While the `a` command appends after the current position, the `A` command
appends at the end of the current line. It doesn't matter where our cursor is
at the time, pressing `A` will switch to Insert mode and move the cursor to the
end of the line. In other words, it squashes `$a` into a single keystroke. In
_Two for the Price of One_, on page 6, we see that Vim has a handful of compound
commands.

Here is a refinement of our previous example:

By using `A` instead of `$a`, we give the dot command a boost. Instead of
having to position the cursor at the _end_ of the line we want to change, we
just have to make sure it is _somewhere_ (anywhere!) on that line. Now we can
repeat the change on consecutive lines just by typing `j.` as many times as it
takes.

One keystroke to move, another to execute. That's about as good as it gets!
Watch for this pattern of usage, because we'll see it popping up in a couple
more examples.

Although this formula looks terrific for our short example, it's not a
universal solution. Imagine if we had to append a semicolon to fifty
consecutive lines. Pressing `j.` for each change starts to look like a lot of
work. For an alternative approach, skip ahead to Tip 30, on page 61.
