The Vim Way
===========

Our work is repetitive by nature. Whether we're making the same small change in
several places or moving around between similar regions of a document, we
repeat many actions. Anything tat can streamline a repetitive workflow will
save our time multi-fold.

Vim is optimized for repetition. Its efficiency stems from the way it tracks
our most recent actions. We can always replay the last change with a single
keystroke. Powerful as this sounds, it's useless unless we learn to craft our
actions so that they perform a useful unit of work when replayed. Mastering
this concept is the key to becoming effective with Vim.

The dot command is our starting point. This seemingly simple command is the
most versatile tool in the box, an understanding it is the first step toward
Vim mastery. We'll work through a handful of simple editing tasks that can be
rapidly completed with the dot command. Although each task looks quite
different from the next, their solutions almost converge. We'll identify an
ideal editing formula, which requires only one keystroke to move and another
to execute.
