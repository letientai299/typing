Chapter 5: Command-Line mode
============================

Vim traces its ancestry back to vi, which is where the modal editing paradigm
was conceived. In turn, vi traces its ancestry back to a line editor called ex,
which is why we have Ex commands. The DNA of these early Unix text editors is
preserved in modern Vim. For some line-oriented tasks, Ex commands are still
the best tool for the job. In this chapter, we'll learn how to use Command-Line
mode, which exposes us the vestiges of ex.
