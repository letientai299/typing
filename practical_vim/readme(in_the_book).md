_Practical Vim_ is for programmers who want to raise their game. You've heard
it said that in the hands of an expert, Vim shreds text at the speed of
thought. Reading this book is your next step toward that end.

_Practical Vim_ is a fast track to Vim mastery. It won't hold you by the hand,
but beginners can find the prerequisite knowledge by running through the Vim
tutor, an interactive lesson distributed with Vim. _Practical Vim_ builds on
this foundation by highlighting core concepts and demonstrating idiomatic
usage.

Vim is highly configurable. However, customization is a personal thing, so I've
tried to avoid recommending what should or should not go into your _vimrc_
file. Instead, _Practical Vim_ focuses on the core functionality of the editor
- the stuff that's always there, whether you're working over SSH on a remote
server or using a local instance of GVim, with plugins installed to add extra
functionality. Master Vim's core, and you'll gain portable access to a text
editing power tool.


How This Book Is Structured
---------------------------

_Practical Vim_ is a recipe book. It's not designed to be read from start to
finish. (I mean it! At the start of the next chapter, I'll advise you to skip
it and jump straight to the action.) Each chapter is a collection of tips that
are related by a theme, and each tip demonstrates a particular feature in
action. Some tips are self-contained. Others depend upon material elsewhere in
the book. Those tips are cross-referenced so you can find everything
easily.

_Practical Vim_ doesn't progress from novice to advanced level, but each
individual chapter does. A less-experienced reader might prefer to make  a
first pass through the book, reading just the early tips in each chapter. A
more advanced reader might choose to focus on the later tips or move around the
book as needed.


A Note on the Examples
----------------------

In Vim, there's always more than one way to complete any given task. for
example, in Chapter 1, _The Vim Way_, on page 1, all of the problems are
designed to illustrate an application of the dot command, but every one of them
could also be solved using the `:substitute` command.

On seeing my solution, you might think to yourself, "Wouldn't it be quicker to
do it _this way_?" And you may well be right! My solutions illustrate a
particular technique. Look beyond their simplicity, and try to find a
resemblance to the problems that you face daily. That's where these techniques
will save you time.


Learn to Touch Type, Then Learn Vim
-----------------------------------

If you have to look down to find the keys on the keyboard, the benefits of
learning Vim won't come fast. Learning to touch type is imperative.

Vim traces its ancestry back to the classic Unix editors, _vi_ and _ed_ (see
_On the Etymology of Vim (and family)_ on page 53). These predate the mouse and
all of the point-and-click interfaces that came with it. In Vim, everything can
be done with the keyboard. For the tough typist, that means Vim does everything
_faster_.
