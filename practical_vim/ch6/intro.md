Chapter 6: Manage Multiple Files
================================

Vim lets us work on multiple fiels at the same time. The buffer list lets us
keep track of the set of files that we've opened in the course of an editing
session. In Tip 36, on page 77, we'll learn how to interact with this list as
well las learn the distinction between a file and a buffer.

The argument list is a greate complement to the buffer list. In tip 37, on
page 80, we'll see how to use the `:args` command to group files from the
buffer list into a collection. We can then traverse the list of execute an Ex
command on each member of the set using the `:argdo` command.

Vim allows us to divide our workspace into split windows. We'll learn how in
tip 39, on page 85. Then in Tip 40, on page 89, we'll see how Vim's tabbed
interface can be used to organize split windows into a collection.
