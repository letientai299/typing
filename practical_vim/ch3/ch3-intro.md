Chapter 3: Insert mode
======================

Most of Vim's commands are triggered from other modes, but some functionality
is within easy reach from Insert mode. In this chapter, we'll explore these
commands. Although delete, yank, and put commands are all triggered from Normal
mode, we'll see that there is a convenient shortcut for pasting text from a
register without leaving Insert mode. We'll learn that Vim provides two easy
ways for inserting unusual characters that are not represented on the keyboard.

Replace mode is a special case of insert mode, which overwrites existing
characters in the document. We'll learn how to invoke this and consider some
scenarios where it proves useful. We'll also meet Insert Normal mode, a
sub-mode that lets us fire a single Normal mode command before dropping us back
into insert mode.

Autcompletion is the most advanced functionality available to us from Insert
mode. We'll cover it in depth in Chapter 19. Dial X for Autocompletion, on page
275.
