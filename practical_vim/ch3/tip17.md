Tip 17: Insert Unusual Characters by Character Code
===================================================

_Vim can insert any character by its numeric code. This can be handy for
entering symbols that are not found on the keyboard_

We can tell Vim to insert any arbitrary character if we know its numeric code.
From Insert mode, we just have to type `<c-v>{code}`, where `{code}` is the
address of the character that we want to insert.

Vim expects the numeric code to consist of three digits. Suppose, for example,
that we wanted to insert an uppercase "A" character. The character code is 65,
so we would have to enter it as `<C-v>065`.

But what if we wanted to insert a character whose numeric code is longer than
three digits? For example, the Unicode basic Multilingual Plane has an address
space for up to 65,535 characters. It turns out that we can enter all of these
using a four-digit hexadecimal code if we type `<c-v>u{1234}` (note the `u`
preceding the digit this time.) Let's say we wanted to insert an inverted
question mark symbol ("Â¿"), which is represented by the character code `00bf`.
From insert mode, we would just have to type `<c-v>u00bf`. See `:h
i_ctrl-v_digit` for more details.

If you want to find out the numeric code for any character in your document,
just place the cursor on int and trigger the `ga` command. This outputs a
message at the bottom of the screen, revealing the character code in decimal
and hexadecimal notations (see `:h ga`). Of course, this is of little help if
you want to know the code for a character that is not area Edy in your
document. In that case, you might want to look up the Unicode tables.

In another scenario, if the `<c-v>` command is followed by any _nondigit_ key,
it will insert the character by that key literally. For example, if the
`expandtab` option is enabled, then pressing `<tab>` key will insert space
characters instead of a tab character. However, pressing `<c-v><tab>` will
`always` insert a tab character literally, regardless of whether `expandtab` is
enabled or not.

Table 3, Inserting Unusual Characters, on page 33, summarizes the commands for
entering unusual characters.

Keystrokes           | Effect
---------------------|-------
`<c-v>{123}`         | Insert character by decimal code
`<c-v>u{1234}`       | Insert character by hexadecimal code
`<c-v>{nondigit}`    | Insert nondigit literally
`<c-k>{char1}{char2}`| Insert character represented by {char1}{char2}` digraph.
